# India TB Pathway Data Analysis Report 

The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It
examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis
patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).

```{python}
# importing the necessary packages 
import pandas as pd 
import plotly.express as px 
from itables import show
```


```{python}
india_tb_df = pd.read_csv("/Users/olga/Desktop/Week_4/2.graph_course_python/Data/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv")

show(india_tb_df)
```

## Analysis of chest X-ray results against smoking habits.


```{python}
# using a bivariate histogram to show the relationship between chest xray results and smoking habits of the patients.

tb_plot = px.histogram(india_tb_df, 
            x = "Smoking",
            color = "Chext Xray",
            barnorm = "percent",
            text_auto = ".0f", 
            title = " Distribution of the chest x-ray results disaggregated by smoking status.")

tb_plot.show()
```

Based on the above plot, a higher proportion of clients that are smokers (83%) tested positive of TB on their chest xray compared to the non smokers (76%) which indicates. 


## Pre-diagnostic costs 


```{python}
#| echo: false
# Getting the cost of the first visit 

highest_first_visit_cost = int(india_tb_df["first visit cost"].max())



```

The amount of the highest cost of the first visit was **`{python} highest_first_visit_cost`**
